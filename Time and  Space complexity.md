# Time Complexity

Time complexity does not refer to the actual time taken by our code to produce an output, as this can vary from system to system. Instead, it describes the rate at which the time taken increases with respect to the input size.

The formula is:

`{slope} = {time taken}\{input size}`

It is measured in Big O notation, such as \( O(n) \), where \( n \) represents the number of steps.

## Rules to Calculate Time Complexity

* Always consider the worst-case scenario.
* Ignore constant factors when the variable \( n \) is large.
* Ignore lower-order terms compared to \( n \).




# Space Complexity 

## Auxilary Space
Space that we take to solve problems 

## input space   
space we use to store variable  

`Space Complexity = Auxilary Space + Input Space`
