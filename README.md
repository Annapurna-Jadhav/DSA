# DSA Preparation Journey

Welcome to my repository where I document my daily preparation for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). This is a step-by-step journey starting from the basics to build a strong foundation in DSA using C++.

## Learning Plan

I will be sharing detailed insights and learnings from each day as I progress through my preparation. Below is a brief overview of the topics covered:

## **Basics of CPP**
1.[ variables and operators](https://github.com/Annapurna-Jadhav/DSA/blob/8234c61e9efe8489f0d701f481fd2b9dd6603213/CP/varope.cpp) 

2.[ conditionals](https://github.com/Annapurna-Jadhav/DSA/blob/main/CP/conditions.cpp)

3.[loops](https://github.com/Annapurna-Jadhav/DSA/blob/145f32581db5b5aa142403686a4693366f28321a/CP/loop.cpp)

4.[square pattern](https://github.com/Annapurna-Jadhav/DSA/blob/main/CP/squarePattern.cpp)
