# DSA Preparation Journey

Welcome to my repository where I document my daily preparation for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). This is a step-by-step journey starting from the basics to build a strong foundation in DSA using C++.

## Learning Plan

I will be sharing detailed insights and learnings from each day as I progress through my preparation. Below is a brief overview of the topics covered:

### Day 1: Introduction to C++

- **Topics Covered:** Variables and Operators

### Day 2: Control Structures

- **Topics Covered:** Conditionals and Loops

Stay tuned for more updates as I continue to explore and learn new concepts in DSA.
