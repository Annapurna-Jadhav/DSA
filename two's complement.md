# Binary Complements: Understanding 1's and 2's Complements

This guide provides a simple explanation of how to calculate 1's and 2's complements of binary numbers, with examples to illustrate the process.

## 1's Complement

To find the 1's complement of a binary number, follow these steps:

1. **Example Binary Number**: `1010`
2. **1's Complement Calculation**:
   - Add a zero as a prefix: `01010`
   - Replace each `1` with `0` and each `0` with `1`: `00101`

## Calculating 2's Complement of a Negative Number

Let's calculate the 2's complement of `-10`:

1. **Binary Representation of 10**: `1010`
2. **Add MSB for Negative Numbers**: `01010`
3. **Convert to 1's Complement**: `10101`
4. **Add 1 to the Binary**:
   - In binary, `1 + 1 = 10`
   - Result: `10110`

## Calculating 2's Complement from Binary

To calculate the 2's complement from a binary number, it's important to know if the number is negative or positive. Let's use the example `10110`:

1. **Convert Directly to 1's Complement**: `01001`
2. **Add 1**: `01010`

## Conclusion

Understanding 1's and 2's complements is crucial for binary arithmetic, especially in computing systems where negative numbers are represented using 2's complement. This guide provides a straightforward approach to calculating these complements with clear examples.
